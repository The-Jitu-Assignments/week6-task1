Login Process:-
  1. Capture the user data(email, password);
  2. Check if the email provided exists in the database.
  3. If the email exists compare the password provided with the password saved 
    in the database.
  4. We use bcrypt to compare the passwords because the password saved in the database was hashed.
  5. If the passwords match we use JWT to encode the user information and store it in
    a token which will be used on frontend.
