Login Process:-
  1. Capture the user data(email, password);
  2. Check if the email provided exists in the database.
  3. If the email exists compare the password provided with the password saved 
    in the database.
  4. We use bcrypt to compare the passwords because it was saved password in the database was hashed.
  5. If the password provide is correct we use JWT to encode the user information and store it
    a token which will be used on frontend.
