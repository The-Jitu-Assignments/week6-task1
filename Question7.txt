Explain the code below

let x = [1, 2, 3, 4] === [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(x);

x = 'hello' === 'hello';
console.log(x);

The first console.log prints false because two arrays can not be equal even if
the contain same elements. This is because they are stored in different location
while the second console.log prints true because it compares strings which are
primitive data type are they are compared by value;
